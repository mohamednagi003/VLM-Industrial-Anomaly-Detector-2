# VLM-Industrial-Anomaly-Detector

## Project Objective
[cite_start]Design and build a software system to detect user-defined anomalies in industrial video streams using a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM)[cite: 4, 5].

## Technologies
* [cite_start]**Language:** Python [cite: 9]
* [cite_start]**AI Model:** Pre-trained VLM (e.g., CLIP) [cite: 10]
* [cite_start]**Web Interface:** Streamlit [cite: 12]
* [cite_start]**Version Control:** Git/GitHub [cite: 13]

## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup
To run the project, install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

### 2. Team Workspaces
* **ML Core Team (Colab/GPU):** Focus on the logic in the `/ml_core` folder.
* **UI/UX Team (Local/VS Code):** Focus on the front-end interface in the `/ui` folder.
